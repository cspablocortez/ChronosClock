## Blender Projects

1. **Cubes**: I started off with a cube and formed it into a rectangular prisma nd added the grooves at the top to give it some definition. For the rectangular prisms's animation all I did was make it traverse on the Y-Axis at different speeds. The light-emitting beams were made by making a texture with emission run from right to left while spinning on the X-Axis.

2. **Lights**: The Lights project that I created was a very simple but visually pleasing animation that I made using small circles with an emission effect and a bit of camera tweaking. For the animation I made the pattern change by changing the properties of the grid making a simple loop animation.

3. **Halloween Web**: This project was purposely made for Halloween because at the time of creating it, Halloween was just around the corner. The build was made with a variety of cylinders with a metallic material and the second cylinder was made with a larger amount of space in between the fractures of the cylinder and the material used was an orange emission material.
